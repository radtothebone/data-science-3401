    "In this exercise, you will create a class called `Pickaboo`, representing a magical, playful creature. Your task is to design the class with attributes and methods to manage Pickaboo’s behavior and characteristics. Follow the instructions below to complete the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define a class called `Pickaboo`** with the following attributes:\n",
    "   - `name` (string): The name of the Pickaboo.\n",
    "   - `mood` (string): The current mood of Pickaboo, which can be `\"happy\"`, `\"curious\"`, `\"sneaky\"`, or `\"angry\"`. It should start as `\"happy\"`.\n",
    "   - `orb_colors` (list): A list of colors that represent the glowing orbs on Pickaboo's tail. Initially, this should contain three colors: `\"blue\"`, `\"pink\"`, and `\"purple\"`.\n",
    "   - `energy_level` (integer): A number representing Pickaboo's energy, which should start at 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create the following methods for the `Pickaboo` class**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `change_mood(self, new_mood)`: This method changes Pickaboo's mood. If the new mood is `\"angry\"`, reduce the energy level by 20. If the new mood is `\"happy\"`, increase the energy level by 10. Use a conditional statement to handle these changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `play_hide_and_seek(self)`: This method simulates Pickaboo playing hide-and-seek. It should reduce the energy level by 15 and change the mood to `\"sneaky\"`. If the energy level is too low (less than 30), print that Pickaboo is too tired to play.Use a conditional statement to handle these changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `recharge(self)`: This method increases Pickaboo's energy level by 30 and changes the mood to `\"happy\"`. Make sure the energy level does not go above 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `glow_orbs(self)`: This method should loop through the `orb_colors` list and print out the colors of the glowing orbs. If Pickaboo’s mood is `\"angry\"`, temporarily add `\"red\"` to the list of orb colors while glowing. Use a conditional statement to handle these changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Additional Task:**\n",
    "   - Create an instance of the `Pickaboo` class with a name of your choice.\n",
    "   - Use the methods to:\n",
    "     1. Change its mood to `\"curious\"`.\n",
    "     2. Play hide-and-seek with Pickaboo.\n",
    "     3. Recharge its energy.\n",
